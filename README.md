# Malamute

###### Description

Malamute (final name TBD) should provide a framework and the basic IP for constructing power-efficient cache-coherent hardware accelerated compute enclaves, with a focus on security and extensibility. It should not place any hard requirements upon the IP integrator to use any particular CPU or ISA, or any particular hardware accelerator IP blocks.

### Project Status

This repository is part of AmbiML, an open collaborative research / exploration effort into RISC-V microarchitecture design and development.
